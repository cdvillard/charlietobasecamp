			<h1>I heard Basecamp is hiring.</br>I want to apply.</h1>
			<p>Hey Basecamp!</p>
			<p>My name is Charles. I'm a graphic designer with some marketing background under my belt. Weary of the office grind, I started checking <a href="http://weworkremotely.com">We Work Remotely</a> several times a day looking for the right opportunity. I never thought that opportunity would be to work with all of these cool people at Basecamp. <span id="pointer">>></span></p>
			<p>I am a fan of Basecamp, but not because I use products daily. I haven't had that pleasure yet. I am a fan of your philosophies surrounding design and the work environment. Until recently, I checked We Work Remotely almost daily just for the heck of it. I read Signal vs. Noise whenever I need a spark of inspiration. Your <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/#vooza">debate against Matthew Stillman</a> on remote working was simply brilliant and hugely convincing, and I'm thinking of approaching Ruby and Ruby on Rails as the next tools in my growing web development tool box.</p>

			<h2>I don't use Basecamp.</br>So why me?</h2>

			<span id="whyme">I fit the bill.</span>
			<p>Let's just get this boring part out of the way. I fill the requirements listed as per your solicitation. I worked in design and marketing right out of college, and have dabbled in both the print and digital spaces. I originally wanted to be a copy writer, but design sucked me in before I could get too many one-liners out. I can still write some tight copy, but my heart lies with pixels and picas.</p>

			<span id="whyme">I'm well-rounded.</span>
			<p>In my time, I've worn the hats of designer, marketer, copy writer, proposal writer, cartoonist, photographer, translation technologist, and a few more that don't come to mind right now. To be frank, I'm not afraid to draw up that comp for you, but I don't mind getting my hands muddy with other things either.</p>

			<span id="whyme">I want to learn more.</span>
			<p>I've worked for a lot of great companies in my time, but never really got the chance to grow professionally. Currently, I work for the Miami Herald Media Company here in Miami, Florida. They're a great bunch of people, a local institution that's taught me a lot about newsprint, but they don't fit into my long-term goals.</p>

			<p>As of last year, I started learning web development for fun and profit, and while I've had the chance to do a bit of markup for them, I can't say it was a learning experience. But what better place for someone to learn more about the world of the web than Basecamp, the home of Ruby on Rails? After reading about <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3139-one-month-in-design">what Mig learned in the first month</a>, how could I not be enticed?</p>

			<span id="whyme">I'm not a shy guy.</span>
			<p>I don't mind getting out from behind the screen to talk to people face-to-face. I've represented companies and organizations at a number of events and conventions in the past, and have worked as an entertainer for an amazing non-profit stage combat troupe called Urban Ronin. I enjoy connecting with people, whether it be peers at a professional conference or children from on stage.</p>
